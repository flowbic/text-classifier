# Text classification of Wikipedia articles
Machine learning system that classifies Wikipedia texts and compares ML-techniques accuracy. 

## Compares tecniques
Texts are classified with two different algorithms.
The algorithms are Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes and Linear SVC (Support Vector Machines).

These two algorithms are runned two times. 
The first run executes the two algorithms and uses word count.
The second run executes both algorithms again, bu Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is used to convert word count to word frequency.
